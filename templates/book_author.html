<h3>Recent Work</h3>

<p>
    His most recent publication resulted from a trip to the Los Angeles Golf Country Club. Kevin was there 
    to catalogue their golf ball collection. As well as completing the assignment, he uncovered previously 
    undocumented golf balls. This inspired Kevin to embark on 4 years of research which saw the publication, 
    in December 2021, of the first edition of <em>The Collectible Golf Balls Directory, Folio I</em>.

    and has given up on ever being a single-figure handicap golfer.
