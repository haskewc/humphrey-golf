    1845 marks the year in which the game of golf underwent its first major change with the invention 
    of the gutta ball made from gutta-percha.
</p>

<h3>What is Gutta-Percha?</h3>

<p>
    In Malaysia 'gueta' means gum and 'percha' means cloth. In its natural state gutta-percha is a 
    hard and resilient substance and is derived from the sap of the <strong>Palaquium</strong> genus of tree 
    that is indigenous to South East Asia.
</p>

<p>
    To collect the gutta the Palaquium has to be felled and circular incisions made through the bark 
    into which the gum slowly accumulates. Once the gum has been extracted, any resin is drained off 
    to create a pure gutta substance, then is cooled and shaped into manageable cloth wrapped blocks.
</p>

<h3>The Inventors</h3>

<p>
    It is still unknown who first thought of using gutta-percha to make golf balls. The three most 
    likely candidates were all Scottish:

    <p><strong>William Smith</strong> — A watch and clock maker from Musselburgh who started his watch-making business in 1846-1847.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Robert A. Paterson</strong> — A St. Andrews divinity student who experimented with gutta-percha during his studies.</p>
    
    <p><strong>John Paterson</strong> — Robert's half brother, who continued developing the technology after Robert left for America.</p>
</div>

<h3>The Problem of Air Pockets</h3>

<p>
    John Paterson tried to improve the technique of dispelling the small air pockets within the gutta 
    ball that created internal cracks and made it fragile. Air trapped in the gutta caused an uneven 
    distribution of weight that affected the balance and the ball's flying potential.
</p>

<p>
    It was soon apparent that a good-quality gutta was needed to make golf balls. The early balls 
    often broke up due to impurities in the gutta and unsophisticated production techniques.

<blockquote>
    The introduction of the gutta-percha ball democratized golf, making it accessible to the masses 
    rather than just the wealthy who could afford expensive feather balls.
