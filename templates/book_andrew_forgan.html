<h3 style="text-align: center; font-style: italic; color: var(--color-text-light);">The First Ever Golf Ball Collector?</h3>

<p>
    <em>Golfing Magazine</em> in October 1907 ran an article on <strong>Andrew Forgan</strong>, the younger brother of 
    <strong>Robert Forgan</strong>, highlighting his collection of <strong>180 vintage golf balls</strong>.
</p>

<blockquote>
    "There is the 'Inglis Unique' named after Lord President Inglis, marked with a series of circles. 
    There is the 'Mother' which no ball has ever more curiously been christened. This title has a very 
    graceful history. The mould in which the ball was made was presented to Mr. Forgan by his mother 
    when she paid him a visit at Perth in 1878; and in those days £5 was the price of a mould. It will 
    be readily understood why Mr. Forgan called his new possession 'Mother's Mould'."
</blockquote>

<p>
    Andrew Forgan's collection represents one of the earliest documented golf ball collections, 
    showcasing the diversity and craftsmanship of gutta-percha balls from the formative years of the game.

    <h4>The Forgan Family Legacy</h4>
    <p>
        The Forgan name is synonymous with quality golf equipment. Robert Forgan established one of 
        the most respected club-making businesses in St Andrews, while his brother Andrew developed 
        this remarkable collection of early golf balls.
