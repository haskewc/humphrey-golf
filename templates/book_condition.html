    Understanding condition grades is essential for collectors. The following standardized grading system 
    is used throughout this directory for <strong>balls</strong>, <strong>wrappers</strong>, and <strong>boxes</strong>.
</p>

<h3>⛳ Balls</h3>

<div class="condition-grid">
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>A1 Condition</h4>
        <p>100% paint coverage, without marks or blemishes of any size. The ultimate condition for collectors.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>A2 Condition</h4>
        <p>75% PLUS paint coverage, from a high just short of A1 to one that has some very small areas of paint loss and/or with a slight hair line crack or defect.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>A3 Condition</h4>
        <p>40% PLUS paint coverage on about half the surface, and/or a scruffy appearance and could have several marks, cuts or cracks.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>A4 Condition</h4>
        <p>DISTRESSED with 0-40% paint coverage, a ball retrieved from a pond, serious defects to the cover, deep cuts, and/or missing areas of the ball's cover.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>A5 Condition</h4>
        <p>Repainted, Refurbished and/or Decorated. These balls have been altered from their original state.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="condition-grid">
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>W1 Condition</h4>
        <p>MINT wrapper and label as fresh as it left the manufacturer.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>W2 Condition</h4>
        <p>WELL ABOVE AVERAGE from an example that is almost complete down to one with a small tear or two.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>W3 Condition</h4>
        <p>AVERAGE TO BELOW AVERAGE scruffy appearance, oxidisation, some paper lacking and/or missing a label.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>W4 Condition</h4>
        <p>WELL BELOW AVERAGE TO DISTRESSED with serious damage to the paper, or only remnants of the wrapping exists and without the label.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<h3>📥 Boxes</h3>

<div class="condition-grid">
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>B1 Condition</h4>
        <p>Clean and sharp, the ultimate, as it left the printers.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>B2 Condition</h4>
        <p>WELL ABOVE AVERAGE from an almost complete example down to one with maybe a tear, graffiti, tape repair or other damage.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="condition-card">
        <h4>B3 Condition</h4>
        <p>AVERAGE TO BELOW AVERAGE with only remnants of card board, all scruffy with major repairs.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div style="background: var(--color-cream); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 2rem;">
    <h4>💡 Note for Collectors</h4>
    <p>
        Condition grades can significantly affect value. An A1 ball may be worth 2-3 times more than an A3 
        example of the same type. Always examine photographs carefully and, where possible, inspect balls 
        in person before purchasing.
