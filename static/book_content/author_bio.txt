Kevin W. McGimpsey is the British Golf Collectors Society's Murdoch Medal winner of 2004 for his seminal book, *The Story of the Golf Ball*.

A former Captain in the Parachute Regiment, Kevin traded his red beret for a career in antique and collectible golfing memorabilia, an area he has firmly established himself as an internationally renowned expert.

**Recent Work**

His most recent publication resulted from a trip to the Los Angeles Golf Country Club. Kevin was there to catalogue their golf ball collection. As well as completing the assignment, he uncovered previously undocumented golf balls. This inspired Kevin to embark on 4 years of research which saw the publication, in December 2021, of the first edition of *The Collectible Golf Balls Directory, Folio I*.

**The Modern Game**

Kevin also has a love of the modern game. Caddying twice for his brother, the British Amateur Champion Garth McGimpsey, in both the 1985 Open Championship and the 1986 Masters, which included a coveted practice round with Jack Nicklaus. Today he plays golf twice a week and has given up on ever being a single-figure handicap golfer.

**Personal Life**

Kevin has been very happily married to his wife Paddy for 40 years. They have three grown up children, three grandchildren and live in Chester, England.

**Auction Experience**

In May 2003, Kevin was appointed the lead golf expert at Bonhams1793 auction house. Responsible for their prestigious golf sales in both the UK and the USA, and overseeing the insurance valuations for renowned Golf Clubs, including Carnoustie and Royal Troon.
